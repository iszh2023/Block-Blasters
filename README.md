# Block Blasters

**Block Blasters** is a fast-paced arcade dodging game where falling blocks, sliding traps, and chaotic powerups combine into a frantic survival challenge. Your mission is simple:

**Stay alive.
Collect powerups.
Break blocks.
Score as high as you can.**

## 🎮 Gameplay

You control a small character inside an arena while blocks of different types spawn from above or rush in from the sides. As time passes:

* Blocks fall faster
* Patterns get harder
* Powerups become essential
* Chaos increases every second

It’s easy to learn but surprisingly difficult to master.

## 🔥 Features

### **🧱 Block Variety**

Not all blocks behave the same:

* **Normal blocks** – basic falling hazards
* **Heavy blocks** – drop at high speed
* **Explosive blocks** – blow up on impact
* **Sliding blocks** – sweep horizontally and trap you
* **Mystery blocks** – unpredictable effects

Each round mixes in new block types and patterns.

## 💥 Powerups

Powerups spawn occasionally and can completely change your run:

* **⭐ Shield** – temporary invincibility
* **⚡ Speed Boost** – move faster to escape tight spots
* **🔨 Block Breaker** – destroy blocks on contact
* **🌀 Slow Time** – dramatically reduces block speed
* **💣 Mega Bomb** – clears large sections of the arena
* **❓ Randomizer** – a surprise effect every time

Using the right powerup at the right time is key to surviving long runs.

## 🧠 Difficulty Curve

The game ramps up dynamically:

* More blocks per wave
* Faster spawn cycles
* Reduced powerup frequency
* More dangerous block types

What starts slow gradually becomes pure chaos.

# Overview

This is a minimal Python program that serves as a simple console application. The program's sole purpose is to output the letter "i" to the console when executed. It represents a basic Python script structure with proper documentation and follows Python best practices for executable scripts.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Core Application Structure
- **Single-file architecture**: The entire application consists of one Python file (`main.py`)
- **Console-based output**: Uses Python's built-in `print()` function for output
- **Executable script pattern**: Uses shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) for direct execution on Unix-like systems

## Programming Language
- **Python 3**: Modern Python version specified in shebang
- **Standard library only**: No external dependencies or imports required

## Design Patterns
- **Procedural programming**: Simple sequential execution without classes or complex structures
- **Direct execution**: No function definitions or complex control flow

# External Dependencies

## Runtime Requirements
- **Python 3**: The application requires Python 3 interpreter to be installed on the system

## Third-party Services
- None: This application is completely self-contained and does not integrate with any external services, APIs, or databases

## External Libraries
- None: The application uses only Python's built-in functionality and does not require any external packages or libraries
